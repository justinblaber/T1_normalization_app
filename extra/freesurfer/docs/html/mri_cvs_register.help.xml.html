<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>mri_cvs_register</p>

<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>Combined Volume and Surface Registration</p>

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This program performs subject-to-subject or subject-to-atlas volume registration using the combined volumetric and surface-based (CVS) registration algorithm (Postelnicu-Zollei-Fischl, TMI09). The CVS registration stream consists of 3 steps: (1) surface-based registration, (2) elastic registration and (3) volumetric regsitration. By default, in the current implementation of the script, step (3) consists of two steps: (i) registration using aseg volumes and (ii) registration using intensity volumes. This combination of the non-linear volumetric registrations proved to be very robust and accurate, but the (i) step could be eliminated if quicker execution time is required by using the \"--noaseg\" flag. Make sure that SUBJECTS_DIR is properly set before calling this script. </p>

<h1>POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS</h1>
<h3>None</h3>


<h1>REQUIRED-FLAGGED ARGUMENTS</h1>
<table border="3">
<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>--mov subjid</td><td>FreeSurfer subject name as found in $SUBJECTS_DIR. This identifies the subject that is to be moved / registered to the target. </td></tr>
</table>


<h1>OPTIONAL-FLAGGED ARGUMENTS</h1>
<table border="3">
<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>--template subjid</td><td>FreeSurfer subject name as found in $SUBJECTS_DIR (or --templatedir). This identifies the subject that is to be kept fixed (template). If this argument is missing from the function call, the CVS template is used. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--templatedir directory</td><td>This option needs to be used if the template subject's SUBJECTS_DIR directory is different from that of the moving subject. All the relevant FS recon files should be located here. By default, without using this option, this parameter is set to be SUBJECTS_DIR. If the --template argument is not specified, so the registration is to the CVS template, this parameter is implicitely set. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--mni</td><td>Use the CVS atlas in MNI152 space as a target for registration (as opposed to the default CVS template).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--outdir directory</td><td>Name of the output directory where all the registration results are written. The default is $SUBJECTS_DIR/$subjid/cvs, where subjid is the subject id of the moving subject. The final output directory is going to be ~.6G, but make sure that there is around double that amount of space available for the computations.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--asegfname fname</td><td>Name of the segmentation volume that should be used in order to guide the volumetric registration step. The default value is aseg. Note that both the template and the moving subject needs to have this file if you want to use this option. Also, do not use the file extension of the volume that you are including with this flag!</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Partial run of the registration</h3>

<table border="3">
<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>--step1</td><td>Only do step 1 (spherical registration).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--step2</td><td>Only do step 2 (elastic registration).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--step3</td><td>Only do step 3 (volumetric registration).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--noaseg</td><td>Do not use aseg volumes in the volumetric registration pipeline (default is 0). Setting this option could shorten significantly the time of registration, however, might also take away from the accuracy of the final results.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--nointensity</td><td>Do not use the intensity volumes in the volumetric registration pipeline (default is 0). Setting this option could shorten significantly the time of registration. It also indicates that the intensity values are not to be trusted during the registration.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--hemi</td><td>Run the CVS registration only one of the hemispheres. For example, in case of single hemisphere ex-vivo cases.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--useonlyhemiinvivomov</td><td>Use this possibly with the --hemi option. If the invivo scan is th moving subject, this would mask out the appropriate hemisphere in order to avoid strange artifacts resulting from moving a full brain to a single hemisphere. (The other way around it should not be a problem.) </td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Cleanup Arguments</h3>

<table border="3">
<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>--nocleanup</td><td>Do not delete temporary files (default is 0). If this option is set, make sure you have ~2G space in the output directory.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--keepelreg</td><td>Do not delete elastic registration (default is 0) outcome. If this option is set, make sure ~1G of space is available in the output directory.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--keepallm3z</td><td>Do not delete m3z morph files that are computed during the CVS process (default is 0). </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--cleanall</td><td>Overwrite / recompute all CVS-related morphs that might have been computed prior to the current CVS run (default is 0).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--cleansurfreg</td><td>Overwrite / recompute CVS-related surface registration morphs that might have been computed prior to the current CVS run (default is 0).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--cleanelreg</td><td>Overwrite /recompute the CVS-related elastic registration morph that might have been computed prior to the current CVS run (default is 0).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--cleanvolreg</td><td>Overwrite / recompute CVS-related volumetric morphs that might have been computed prior to the current CVS run (default is 0).</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Others</h3>

<table border="3">
<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>--m3d</td><td>Use m3d instead of m3z in order to represent the registration morphs (and to avoid potential gzip errors).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--openmp N</td><td>Assign the number of nodes for openmp runs to be N. The default is = 1. Note, with N = 8, you can get a threefold speedup.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--nolog</td><td>Do not produce a log file (default is 0).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--version</td><td>Print version and exit.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>--help </td><td>Print help and exit.</td></tr>
